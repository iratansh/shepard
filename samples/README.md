# Samples

This directory contains samples to help get set up, and code that supports
understanding of the documentation.

Samples can be run with the helper script. This set's up a `PYTHONPATH`
variable so that you can import modules with, ie. `import
src.modules.imaging.camera`. Here is the usage:

```sh
samples/run.sh <name>  # Where <name> is the name of the samples
samples/run.sh         # Leaving <name> blank will print all samples to run
```
